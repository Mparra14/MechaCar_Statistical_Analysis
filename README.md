## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![lm_image](https://github.com/Mparra14/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/mechaCar_lm%20summary.png)
* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  As it can be seen in the data above, we have two coefficients that have a significant amount of variance to miles per gallon and those are ground clearance and vehicle length. These two coefficients as well as the intercepts have an effect on the miles per gallon factor. 
* Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

* Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
